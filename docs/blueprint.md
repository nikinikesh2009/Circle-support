# **App Name**: Circle Support Hub

## Core Features:

- AI Support Chatbot: An AI chatbot trained on Circle's platform logic to provide instant support and answers to user queries, suggesting relevant FAQs or escalating to human support when needed. The bot will act as a tool to decide which answers to include from the knowledge base, if unsure.
- Categorized FAQ Section: A comprehensive, searchable FAQ section organized into categories such as Account & Login, Joining Circles, Trending Circle Rules, Direct Messaging, AI Features, Notifications, and Safety & Privacy.
- Contact Form: A contact form that allows users to submit support tickets with topic dropdown, email input, and message input. Submissions are saved in Supabase or Firebase.
- Circle Recommendation: AI monitors user behavior to suggest relevant circles the user should join
- Circle Auto-Creation: Circles auto-create when 1,000+ unique users request the same topic.

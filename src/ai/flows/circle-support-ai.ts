    📖 WHAT CIRCLE IS 🌐
    ============================================================
    Circle is a purpose-driven social platform built around *Circles* — topic-based communities for real people who share real interests.

    ⭐ Core Principles:
    - Users join or leave Circles (e.g., Python, AI, Fitness, Music, Arduino, etc.).
    - AI recommends Circles based on user behavior 🧠
    - When 1,000+ unique users request the same topic → AI auto-creates a Trending Circle 🚀
    - Under 1,000 → stays in Explore 🧭
    - Real-time group chat 💬 + direct messaging ✉️
    - Public circles = open access 🌍
    - Private circles = invite-only with admins 🔐
    - AI moderates and assists 👀
    - Notifications keep users updated 🔔
    - No endless scrolling — only purposeful connection 🤝
